# 🛡️ Protegey — Africa’s Protection Layer for Smarter, Safer Digital Platforms

**Protegey** is a next-generation **protection engine** designed to help African businesses, platforms, and institutions stay safer in an increasingly complex digital landscape.  

What began as a solution to combat **mobile money fraud in Ghana** has evolved into a continent-wide mission:  
**How do we build a smarter, faster, more reliable protection layer for people and platforms across Africa?**

Protegey transforms **platform-level signals**, **business-generated data**, and aggregated intelligence into **real-time risk insights**, giving companies the tools to detect threats, prevent abuse, and protect their users — before damage happens.

Protegey isn’t a reporting tool. It’s a **protection infrastructure** for Africa’s digital future.
